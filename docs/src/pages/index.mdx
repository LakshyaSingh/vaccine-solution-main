## Business problem

Inspired by J&J’s Road to Vaccine, [![0](./images/road-to-vaccine.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koac13B-DvM) that educated the world through its leadership in science and innovation, we invite you on an experiential Vaccine’s Journey with IBM through the lens of technology and open innovations.

As the world awaits the release of the COVID-19 vaccines; we’ve learnt three things about the vaccines themselves:

1. The vaccine once manufactured needs to be in a stable cold state up until inoculation
2. The vaccine travels through various sites across the globe from manufacturing sites to remote clinical trial sites to actual distribution sites to citizens
3. The vaccines when the get release will rise to be the #1 counterfeit product in the world

Exiting the clinical trial phase; the challenge ahead for vaccine manufacturers along with their manufacturing partners lies in effectively delivering the billion vaccines to the most needed areas of the world under uncertain conditions, constrained supplies for vaccine vials, refrigerator container for transportation and fragmented supply chains. 

It may be possible to use machine learning models to identify potential hotspots with granular location precision to inform the supply chain decisions. This requires trust and transparency in AI before triggering any changes to their supply chain execution. 

A vaccine typically travels through multiple sites before being ready for shipment. Multiple companies are involved to manufacture the vaccines. Vaccines need to be handled at an optimal cool temperature (36-46 degrees F) and managed through the cold chain process. For high-value items like vaccines, clinical trial samples and lifesaving medications,  a fluctuation as minor as 2 degrees Celsius can reduce or even eliminate effectiveness, the stakes couldn't be higher. 

Variability in events both internally through the business processes and external events impacting the supply chain across multiple business entities coupled with data residing in multiple clouds presents challenges around anomaly detection that ultimately the vaccin developer is responsible to decision and act on by modifying business processes.

A traditional architecture requires creating new interfaces, integration into systems,  federation and organization of data into a data lake to be ready for any derivation of insights.

Our demonstration today, showcases a developer ready modern architecture comprising of integrated middleware that are used as building blocks to deliver the end to end solution. Use of DevOps tooling and practices accelerates the solution by x factor.

## What we cover

* Speed to innovate and shorten time to deploy to production
design thinking, even storming, microservices, small team, devops, MLops...
* Focus end to end solution running in container on Openshift platform on any cloud provider.
* Using blockchain as multiple business partners are involved, we need to have trusted in data, single source of truth to keep records about the manufactured vaccine lots.
* How to monitor cold chain for refrigerated vaccine during the packaging and transportation using IoT, events, reactive microservices, rules, predictive scoring and blockchain.
* How to develop the solution using Java based microprofile apps, with CI/CD practices using Openshift and kubernetes tooling.
* Scale the solution locally but also at the worldwide level using multi cloud management.

## The IFMA process

The high level vaccine manufacturing process is presented in the figure below.

The important points we want to consider in this Minimum Viable Solution are:

* Multiple partners are engaged in this process.
* Intermediate steps of manufacturing the vaccine used transportation between manufacturers in same or different countries.
* We want to consider the vaccine lot to be released and transported to target destination via airplane.
* We assume the lots are within refrigerated containers.

## Solution development process

When developingi innovative solution we are using the [IBM Garage Methodology](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method) to better understand the requirements, push for innovation and lean solution. We have applied this method to deevelop the current Minimum Viable Product for this solution. You can follow the steps as below:

1. From the IFMA process introduced in previous section, we can work with the subject matter experts to understand the vaccine manufacturing process using [design thinking and event storming workshops](./design/dtw/) so we can understand events, domain and subdomains. 
1. To model the solution and its components, architects and lead developers apply a [Domain Driven Design](design/ddd/) approach to discover bounded context and future microservice landscape. From there they can build the traditional [system context view](/design/syst-ctx/) and [component view](/design/comp-view/) necessary to present a minimum viable architecture.
1. From the decomposition in components, we can jump start the development using [Solution Designer](design/cp4a-sol-builder/) and [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) Java microprofile stacks ([OpenLiberty](https://openliberty.io/) or [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)), combined with the CI/CD capabilities of [gitops](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) and [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd).
1. The asynchronous nature of the process and the integration between services will mix API calls and event driven solution. To use event driven patterns like [event sourcing](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/patterns/event-sourcing/), [Command Query Responsability Seggregation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/patterns/cqrs/), [Saga](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/patterns/saga/) and applying [real time analytics](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/patterns/realtime-analytics/) on the IoT device metrics, the modern architecture uses Apache Kafka, presented in [IBM Event Streams](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams) as part of the [Cloud Pak for Integration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-integration).
1. The vaccine order stipulates to have a great number of vaccine lots to be delivered to any place in the world. It becomes an **supply chain optimization** problem, that the development team addressed with a [solution easily integrated](design/voro/) in the end to end process.
1. Once the vaccine lots are in the refrigerator containers, it is crucial to keep the cold chain end to end, so monitoring the IoT telemetries within [Kafka Streams application](/solution/cold-monitoring/) is very simple, and support all the stateful operators needed to support time based reasoning. This cold chain monitoring is easily enhanced to call a predictive scoring service to detect reefer container anomaly. 
1. The predictive scoring service to detect reefer container anomaly is developed using a [machine learning approach using Watson Studio](/analyze/ws-ml-dev) and Data governance capabilities from the [Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data).
1. Also traceability is key to avoid fraud, and ensure quality of the end to end delivery. So the core solution needs to adopt [Blockchain huperledger](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain) to track the life cycle of the vaccine lots: lot manufacturing events, cold chain violation events, and shipment events are logged into the hyperledger.
1. Finally to make the anomaly detection actionable, we can integrate a human centric business process to support the [refrigerator container maintenance](/solution/bpm/), triggered from the AI scoring service, to avoid bigger and costly failure and optimize the maintenance cost.


<InlineNotification kind="warning">The implemented code does not represent any best practices in term of software development and production delivery. Consider to be a "hello world ++" for most of the components. Those components are exposing basic REST end points and a simple data model to support the main concepts of the business problem with adhoc persistence layer.</InlineNotification>
