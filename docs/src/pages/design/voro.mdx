title: Vaccine Order & Reefer Optimization 
description: Vaccine Order & Reefer Optimization 
---


Special vaccine refrigerator containers (reefers) are needed to ensure cold chain throughout the vaccine delivery. Given the limited number of vaccine refrigerator containers available in the supply chain, and limited available lots at manufacturing sites, the optimization model seeks to create an optimized delivery plan for each vaccine order in real time and continue to improve or repair the delivery plans as new information become available. 

## Use Case 1: Delivery Plan Optimization 

1.	Trigger: a new vaccine order is received
1.	VOCO generates an optimized delivery plan for the order, including decisions on:
    a.	Vaccine lots allocated to the order
    b.	Refrigerator containers to carry out the delivery
    c.	Reposition of reefers to the site of the lot

## Use Case 2 (Future): Delivery Plan Improvement and Repair

1.	Trigger: deviations from the plans (a. container availability, b. inventory replenishment, c. delivery plan execution)
1.	VOCO optimizes all existing delivery and reposition plans to improve the order fulfillment without sacrificing other orders. 

## Data Model

To support the optimization model development we want to define the following data elements:

* Reefer Containers: 
    * Container ID: Unique identifier
    * Capacity: how many vials can the container hold 
    * Status: (ready or in transit or in maintenance) 
    * Location: if in transit status, the transit-to location
    * Available Date: if in transit status, future availability date

* Order: 
    * Order ID: Unique identifier
    * Delivery Location: location to be delivered
    * Priority: higher priority order may displace lower priority order plans
    * Quantity: # of vials ordered
    * Target Delivery Date: if not provided, indicating ASAP

* Lot Inventory: 
    * Lot ID: Unique identifier
    * Quantity: # of vials available in the lot
    * Stock Site: where lot is located

* Replenishment: 
    * Date: replenishment available date
    * Stock Site: where replenished vials to become available
    * Quantity: replenishment quantity

* Reefer Container Reposition Plan: 
    * Container ID
    * From Location 
    * To Location
    * Departure Date
    * Arrival Date

* Order Fulfillment Plan - Lot
    * Order ID
    * Lot ID
    * Qty
    * Departure Date
    * Arrival Date

* Order Fulfillment Plan â€“ Container
    * Order ID
    * Container ID
    * Departure Date
    * Arrival Date

* Transportation
    * Lane ID
    * From Location
    * To Location
    * Hours in Transit
    * Unit Cost for Container Delivery
    * Unit Cost for Container Reposition

* Business Rules/Parameters: 
    * Days to prepare containers pre-delivery
    * Days to unload containers post-delivery
