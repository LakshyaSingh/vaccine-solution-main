This note let you run the order management code with a simple scenario that addresses the following features:

* Create Order with a User interface
* Validate the [outbox pattern]() works to get OrderCreated, OrderUpdated or OrderCancelled Events to Kafka
* Validate the blockchain has a record for the newly created order
* Integrate with the Shipment plan optimization

## Components involved in this demonstration

* Order Service
* Debezium for change data capture on the outbox table
* Kafka 
* Order Optimization Service

## Scenario script

Once the solution is up and running in your target deployment environment (local or OpenShift) execute the following steps to present an end to end demonstration.

### Validate existing vaccine lot shipment plan

### Create an order from the user interface of the Order Service. 

### See how the shipment plan is modified

### Validate the blockchain records

### Present the events created

## Run locally

As a lightweight approach you can run the solution with docker compose. For that the configuration, test data and 

## Run on OpenShift
