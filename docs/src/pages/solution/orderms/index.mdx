## Overview

This project implements a very simple event driven microservice to support the Create, Read, Update, and Delete of vaccine orders. The sale representative uses his mobile device to enter information about an order for a countries or a county within a country. 

 ![](./images/vaccine-order-1.png)

The component writes to a database (DB2) all the order received, but also produce records to Blockchains and once the order is ready calls the Vaccine Order & Reefer Optimization service to get an updated schedule of vaccine lots to ship by airplane. At each order's state modification, events are sent to an event backbone.

The service is created from an [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) stack and packaged as docker images, deployed on Openshift. The Event backbone is IBM Event Streams deliver as part of cloud pack for integration and installed via operator. This [video on the last event streams release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSza-RwvxSE) presents the installation process and the new capabilities.

**Github repository:** [Vaccine-order-mgr](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-order-mgr)

**Order Life Cycle**

The order follows a set of states as described in the following diagram:

 ![](./images/vaccine-order-2.png)

**Kafka topics produced to:**

The service produces to `orders` topic. Below is a representation of a Strimzi topic definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: eventstreams.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: orders
  namespace: cp4i
spec:
  partitions: 3
  replicas: 3
  config:
    retention.ms: 7200000
    segment.bytes: 1073741824
```

**Events produced:**

We will simplify the process and aggregate in the following event types:

* orderCreated
* orderUpdated
* orderCancelled
* orderClosed

Some events are related to the vaccine lot

* lotAssignedToOrder
* lotLoaded
* lotDelivered

## Build

This microservice is built using the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework. The [Appsody CLI](https://appsody.dev/docs/installing/installing-appsody) is a required prerequisite for building the application locally.

Appsody will build the application by pulling the contents of the Quarkus Appsody Stack it is based on and then performs the local application build inside the containerized environment:

```shell
# if not logged yes to your openshift cluster where the docker private registry resides do:
oc login --token=... --server=https://c...
# Get the route to reach the docker private registry
oc get route --all-namespaces | grep registry
# Define the path as environment variable
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=default-route-openshift-image-registry.gse-eda-demo-202005-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
# log to the docker registry using the security token from the openshift console
docker login $IMAGE_REGISTRY
# Then build and push the image
appsody build -t ibmcase/vaccine-order-mgr:0.0.1 [--push-url $IMAGE_REGISTRY] [--push]

# IF you use dockerhub
appsody build -t ibmcase/vaccine-order-mgr:0.0.1 --push --push-url docker.io
```

- You can optionally specify a container tag. If left blank, `latest` will be used.
- You can optionally supply the `--push` flag to automatically push the built image to specified remote repository `--push-url`.

Performing an Appsody build will update the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory with current information for the application image, labels, and annotations fields.

This file needs to be updated to include the different environment variables needed by the application:

## Run

### Pre requisites

The orders are persisted in an external DB2 instance running on IBM Cloud Pack for Data. You need to get the username and password to connect to the DB2 instance with the jdbc URL (something like jdbc:db2://dashdb-....:50001/BLUDB)

### Deployment Parameters

The following deployment parameters are defined in the `app-deploy.yaml` file:

| Name                                     | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KAFKA_BROKERS                            | YES      | Comma-separated list of Kafka brokers to connect to                                                                    |
| KAFKA_APIKEY                             | NO       | API Key used to connect to SASL-secured Kafka brokers. This is required when connecting to IBM Event Streams clusters. |
| TRUSTSTORE_ENABLED                       | NO       | Required to be set to `true` when connecting to IBM Event Streams on the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I).         |
| TRUSTSTORE_PATH                          | NO       | The local path to the required truststore file when connecting to IBM Event Streams on CP4I. See [**Volume Mounts**](#volume-mounts) below.  |
| TRUSTSTORE_PWD                           | NO       | The password for the truststore file used for IBM Event Streams server verification. |
| DBUSER | YES | Database user |
| DBPWD | YES | Database user password |
| SSLJDBCURL | YES | JDBC URL to connect to the database | 

You can define a `.env` script to export the environment variables. 

### Run Locally

When running the microservice locally you must specify all the required [deployment parameters](#deployment-parameters) environment variables. When using `appsody run` use the `--docker-options` flag being passed in from the Appsody CLI command. 
Two options to start locally, one with quarkus, the other one with appsody

**With Quarkus:**

```shell
source ./scripts/setenv.sh
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

**With Appsody:** 

```shell
source ./scripts/setenv.sh

appsody run --docker-options "-e KAFKA_BROKERS=$KAFKA_BROKERS -e KAFKA_APIKEY=$KAFKA_APIKEY -e DBPWD=$DBPWD -e DBUSER=$DBUSER -e SSLJDBCURL=$SSLJDBCURL  -v $(pwd)/certs/es-cert.jks:/deployments/certs/es-cert.jks"
```

For more details on running the microservice locally, consult the Appsody run documentation as well as the deployment information contained in the app-deploy.yaml file.

### Volume mounts

The order manager microservice requires up to one file to be injected at runtime for proper operation. As noted in the `TRUSTSTORE_PATH` parameter above, these files are SSL-based certificates which are required to verify the identity of the external service when calling it. These files are provided as `--docker-options "-v host-src:container-dest ..."` when running the microservice locally and as a Volume Mount when running the microservice on a Kubernetes cluster.

The `TRUSTSTORE_PATH` parameter is documented in the **Event Streams Certificates** section of the [Prerequisites](/microservices/prereqs/#ibm-event-streams-on-redhat-openshift-container-platform) page. The Appsody run command should include a parameter similar to `-v ./certs/es-cert.jks:/config/resources/security/es-cert.jks` in its `--docker-options` string to run this microservice locally.

**Example:** `appsody run --docker-options "-v /Users/myuser/Downloads/es-cert.jks:/config/resources/security/es-ssl/es-cert.jks" ...`

### Running on Openshift 


* Define a config map for the kafka brokers URL coming from the Event streams cluster connection panel:

 ![3](./images/es-cluster-connect.png)

  ```shell
  oc create configmap kafka-brokers --from-literal=brokers='es-cp4i-ibm-es-proxy-route-bootstrap-eventstreams-cp4i.gse-eda-demo-202005-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443' -n vaccine-cold-chain

  ```

* Define a secret for the event streams API key

  ```shell
  oc create secret generic es-cp4i-apikey --from-literal=binding='b77......tgMJZ' -n vaccine-cold-chain
  ```

* Add a secret for the java truststore, downloaded from Event Stream console or using the CLI `cloudctl es certificates --format jks`

  ```shell
  oc create secret generic es-truststore-jks --from-file=certs/es-cert.jks
  ```

* Modify the `app-deploy.yaml` to add environment variables and mount point.

```yaml
  env:
    - name: KAFKA_BROKERS
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          key: brokers
          name: kafka-brokers
    - name: KAFKA_APIKEY
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          key: binding
          name: es-cp4i-apikey
          optional: true
    - name: CERT_LOCATION
      value: /config/certs/truststore.jks
```


The [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/reference/appsody-operator/) is a required prerequisite for deploying the microservice to a remote Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. If the operator is not present in the current project, `appsody deploy... ` will add one.

To deploy the microservice to a remote cluster:

```shell
# Get the route to reach the docker private registry
oc get route --all-namespaces | grep registry
# Define the path as environment variable
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=default-route-openshift-image-registry.gse-eda-demo-202005-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud
# Deploy with appsody

appsody deploy -t vaccine-cold-chain/vaccine-order-mgr:0.0.1 --push-url $IMAGE_REGISTRY --push --no-build --namespace vaccine-cold-chain
```

- You can omit the `--no-build` flag to have Appsody perform a build before deploying the application.
- _**Note:**_ Performing a build at deploy time requires specifying the absolute container reference path, as well as the `--push` flag.
- The neccesary deployment parameter information will be read from the `app-deploy.yaml` file in the same directory.
